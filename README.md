# Premise
This is the JavaScript SDK for [LMNL](https://lmnl.world), a cross-chain protocol for composable Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

It allows developers to easily generate NFTS with seperatable traits, manage trait rarities for their asset collections, add existing NFTs to their creations, and generate hundreds of smart contract templates for use cases across chains.

Get started by requesting an access token from the LMNL network, and 

# Installation
In your project, run:
